# Release 7: Reflection for GPS 1.1
* *What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

Prior to the GPS session I was struggling with the difference between "git pull," "git fetch" and "git merge"

* *What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

During the GPS session our guide helped clarify that the "git pull" function can be used to combine "git fetch" and "git merge"

* *What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

Some questions I asked both my pair and my guide centered around the communication between GitHub and my local terminal. For example, when I create a feature branch, make changes, push it to GitHub, create a pull request, merge it back to the master I go on to verify the changes were merge and I delete the feature branch via GitHub BUT what happens to the feature branch locally as my terminal still recognizes it and the merged changes do not show up on the master branch via my terminal. This is where we discussed how to use the "git pull" command to update my local repo.

* *What still confuses you about Git?*

The concept of Git is still very abstract for me. It's difficult trying to visualize what Git is doing and also trying to grasp how Git and GitHub communicate to eachother, their similarities and their differences.

* *How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

It was actually really awesome! I was very apprehensive at first, but I enjoyed meeting not only the guide, but also my pairing partner. We worked really well together and it helped clear up a lot of confusion. I walked away not only more knowledgeable about severl topics, but certainly more confident about pairing in general and I look forward and welcome more sessions throughout Phase 0.
