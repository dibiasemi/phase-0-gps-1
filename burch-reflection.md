# Aminah's Reflection


* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Git actually wasn't hard to understand, it was just difficult to get on board with having to constantly add and commit files. Now it's becoming second nature.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Staging was definitely one of them. I was a little confused about branches, but that was cleared up as well.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I had questions about fetching, as I don't recall doing much of it during the Week 1 challenges. I didn't have any questions for the guide unless it was to clarify something that she said.
* What still confuses you about Git?
  At this point, I'm pretty confident in my Git abilities. If anything, GitHub would be the confusing one, but the GUI makes it easier to go back and fix mistakes or to look around and figure out whatever it is I'm confused about.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * In the beginning I was nervous, and I think it showed. I had some issues with email and connectivity and of course that doesn't help things. By the end of it I became comfortable, but I was definitely worried about my performance and I felt that I went pretty slow. It's okay, because we get to build on these experiences and I'm excited for my next GPS!
